						<h5>What Do Students Learn at Law School?</h5>
						<h3> THEY LEARN TO WIN</h3>
						<p>A five-year stint at a National Law University is a life changing experience. There is an adage that the primary purpose of law school is to teach you to think like a lawyer. Because laws continually change and evolve, specific rules may quickly lose their relevance, but the ability to think critically will be of the highest value.</p>
						<p>At the center of five years’ experience at Law School lies the academics. Each law school has some fantastic mentors, capable of making you fall in love with their subject. The academic scene is examination preparation, Presentations, Viva and projects are an all important part of the academic calendar that not only makes the academic experience holistic but also encourages you to share and debate what you have learnt.</p>

					MOOT COURT competition simulates a court hearing (usually an appeal against a final decision), in which participants analyse a problem, research the relevant law, prepare written submissions, and present oral argument. Moot problems are typically set in areas of law that are unsettled or that have been subject to recent developments. It is a specialised application of the art of persuasive advocacy. It has been part of the process of training lawyers for centuries and plays an important role in legal education.

				<p><strong>PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE</strong> is modeled on the British Parliamentary System. Accordingly, motions begin with a phrase such as “This House believes that...”, or “This House would...". A team is called either Proposition or Opposition depending on the side it is given. Debaters of each side try to persuade judges to vote for their side within a limited period of time. It is the burden of the opposition team to play "devil's advocate," so to speak. The opposition team tries to find the weaknesses in the government's arguments. Thus, throughout the debate, the government and opposition teams clash on the issues regarding the problem in a back and forth fashion.</p>

			MODEL UNITED NATIONS is a popular activity for those interested in learning more about how the UN operates. The United Nations Model UN Programme aims to build and maintain strong links between the UN and Model UN participants across the globe. It does that through guides and workshops, which teach students how to make their simulations more accurate; by visiting Model UN conferences and sharing firsthand knowledge of what the actual UN is like; and through encouraging Model UN clubs to take real action to support UN values and the Sustainable Development Goals

		<h3>LAW SCHOOL - Academics & more..</h3>

		<p><strong>INTERNSHIP </strong>Being a young Law Aspirant, there is likely a chance that students do not know what exactly they might end up doing? Some might think that they really like Corporate Law but, three years down the line at Law School, they think no, they were wrong, their actual calling is to serve people. They want to go for litigation but then looking at CV, all their internships are in corporate law. So, one should never stick to one kind of internship because that might be a problem as the area of interest changes in the law school years</p>
		<p>Like an NGO internship , it will sensitivise you to what the poorest of the poor go through, how law can make a difference in their lives, teach you what empathy means etc. A trial court and law firm internship, it will give you a ‘true’ picture of legal practice in India and teach you critical skills important for being a good lawyer</p>
		<p><strong>Internships are diverse and can be taken up at NGOs, Governmental Departments & organizations like NHRC, FICCI, CCI, ONGC , Lawyer Chambers, Corporates, Banks, Publishing Houses & Law firms</strong></p>
		<p><strong>SPORTS AND EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES </strong>is the adrenaline and the hunger to prove that we are the best.. Law school is not restricted to academics only. NALSAR has an open field for a stadium and well-constructed courts for various sports. The sporting culture is huge in the top NLUs (NLSIU, NALSAR and NUJS), they come together every year and host the Trilateral Series. INVICTA hosted by NUJS is the biggest sports law school festival. Another extracurricular that is pursued with fervour is music. A large number of amateur bands are present in law schools. NLSIU hosts Strawberry Fields, the largest Amateur Rock festival in the country. Theatre, dancing and other activities are also crowd-pullers.</p>
		<p><strong>In the end life at a law school is a beautiful experience full of joy, despair, and excitement. It makes you a strong, independent person and we assure you that when you graduate you will be a totally different person and you will be ready to face the world.</strong></p>
